Features we want/ need to fix

short goal:

1.) fix centering of login button of register/ login page
2.) indicate when a photo is uploaded when signing up, and when sending one in a message.
3.) create a loading screen - Phil wants to do this
4.) error page
5.) make login/ register form more centered so when you expand the viewport there isnt as much space on the left.
6.) fix the messages so that the bubbles are more below the user that it belongs to.


Long goal:

1.) forgot password functionality, send email to user to reset -> firebase probably has the ability to do this
2.) currently you can create a conversation with yourself, lets make it so that is not possible or if a user does this title the convo as notes
3.) Implement online idicator functionality.
4.) allow user to change their profile picture in the settings.
